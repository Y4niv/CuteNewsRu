# CuteNewsRu
CuteNews.RU is a powerful content management system designed in PHP, uses either textfiles (txtSQL) or MySQL to store its data. It is based on CutePHP's Cutenews.


For now I've uploaded the vanilla version 2.5.4 which should work on PHP versions up to 5.4, my plans are adding the plugins I've wrote and some patches, fixes and upgrades that I've done over the years of using this CMS. Later on when I get the time I'de love to add all the fixes needed for it to run on newer PHP versions.
